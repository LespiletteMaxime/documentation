#Localization

Localizing is one of those features that, as a developer, can be intimidating on other systems. In Devise it's a snap. It is built in out of the box and just takes a few clicks to get it up and running.

Click on the "Languages" section in the administration to view all of the languages preloaded. You can filter these languages using the "Filter" box above the language names. Click "Active" next to the language you wish to activate and... that's it.
