#About this Documentation
We know how it feels to find a new project resource, like what you see, and then find a skeleton of documentation. It sucks. Even in it's first release we are attempting to supply you with robust documentation. 

##<a name="unique-functionality" class="ia"></a>[#](#unique-functionality%21)Unique Functionality

We have done two things in these documents that may be unfamiliar to you.

<div class="beginner" markdown="1">

1. We have provided three modes for the documentation to provide different skill levels with the information most likely to help them. Toggle between 'Beginner', 'Advanced', and 'All' to hide and show sections that 
2. A form is present next to each major section that will allow you to let us know what questions you have or what you still don't understand. This will allow us to update the documentation in the areas that it needs the most help. 

</div>

<div class="advanced" markdown="1">

1. **I guess you already figured this out.**

##<a name="achtung%21" class="ia"></a>[#](#achtung%21)Achtung!

If you've ever read a programming book you've undoubtedly seen these. If not, no worries. We're just trying to get your attention with them. We only use them when we really do have an important thing you should watch out for. There are three flavors:

###Tips

> #### Quick tips
> Don't want our opinion on how to do things? Skip these. 

###Warnings

>> #### Careful, careful, careful
>> It's easy to make a mistake when you see one of these notifications. We have either made the mistake ourselves or have received feedback from other developers that it is easy to misunderstand or miss a step. Tread carefully.

###Upcoming Features

>>> #### New Upcoming Feature (10.1)
>>> When a feature is brand new or maybe is just about to be released we will notate above it with this block. 

##Beer!
To make this novela a little easier to understand and use some real world examples we will use a fictitious narrative of a website about beer. We could have made a blog or a site about cats but this team loves beer. Good beer.

You love code. You love beer. Why not cracking open a cold one right now before you get started.... we'll wait while you run to the fridge.
