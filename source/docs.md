Devise has many tools and as you get into the documentation you'll find out more about some of the more complicated examples. Let's just start off with what one of your client's might experience.

```php
INSERT VIDEO HERE CREATING / EDITING THIS PAGE.
```

This is just the start. This handles the smattering of totally non data-centric content that might appear on a website. Stuff like what you are reading now. But what about data-driven data? Relationships? large data sets? We've got you covered there too.

```
INSERT VIDEO HERE EDITING / CREATING MODELS.
```

So, yea, Devise can do the heavy lifting that your application may need as well. So, ready to get started?
